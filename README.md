# Wine exploration and clustering: Unveiling the stories within Italian wines
Determining workspace structure

Deciding which workspace information to collect

Gathering workspace info

Sure, here's a basic structure for your README.md file:

# Wine Exploration and Clustering

This project aims to explore and cluster Italian wines based on their characteristics.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains all the data used in this project. It is divided into four subdirectories:
  - `external/`: Any external data sources.
  - `interim/`: Intermediate data that has been transformed.
  - `processed/`: The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
  - `raw/`: The original, immutable data dump.

- `models/`: This directory contains the trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries.

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration and testing. The main notebook is `main.ipynb`.

- `reports/`: This directory contains generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc. It also includes any figures generated by the notebooks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python 3.11 installed on your machine. You can then install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the main notebook (`main.ipynb`) to see the exploration and clustering process.

# Setting Docker
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the `pipe` directory where the Dockerfile is located.
3. Build the Docker image by running the following command:
```bash
docker build -t image-name .
```
4. Run the Docker container with the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 image-name
```
In the above commands, replace `image-name` with the name you want to give to your Docker image.

## Accessing the data through the API

The data extraction API is implemented in `data_extraction_api.py` located in the `pipe/src` directory. To access the data, make a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
http://localhost:5000/data
```

## Dependencies

The dependencies for the scripts are listed in `requirements_scripts.txt` located in the `pipe` directory. You can install them with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_scripts.txt
```

## Additional Information

For more detailed information about the project, refer to the `main.ipynb` and `model_tests.ipynb` notebooks located in the `notebooks` directory.

Please replace `image-name` with the name you want to give to your Docker image. Also, make sure to update the API endpoint and the pip command with the correct information based on your project's setup.
